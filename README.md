## What is The Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## How To Use
1. Choose your desired length of work session + break
2. Click start to start the session
3. Once the session is over, an alert will be sent out and break timer will start
4. Once break is over, work session will begin again and repeat the cycle
